### What I learned

I was stuck when i was trying to give outer div a border-radius which I couldn't. but after a lot of searching I found out I can i achieve this using the overflow custom css property.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to work more on my loyout skills.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrap.com) - This helped me to make my design is responsive and mobile first.
